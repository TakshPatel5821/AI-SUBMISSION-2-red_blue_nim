The evaluate function provides a heuristic score to guide the AI’s decision-making using a depth-limited Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This function considers both the number of remaining marbles and the game version ("standard" or "misere") to help the AI favor moves that maximize its chances of winning within the limited search depth.

Design Goals
1.Maximize computer’s advantage by prioritizing moves that leave the opponent in an unfavorable position.
2.Optimize for game version ("standard" or "misere") to reflect different win conditions.
3.Balance immediate gains with long-term strategy by considering the impact of each move in reducing both red and blue marbles.
Inputs
RM (int): Count of remaining red marbles.
BM (int): Count of remaining blue marbles.
CP (int): Current player (0 for human, 1 for computer).
version (str): "standard" (last marble wins) or "misere" (last marble loses).

Evaluation Logic
1.Standard Version:

    The goal is for the computer to be in control when the last marble is taken.
    If both RM and BM are low, favor moves that allow the computer to reach the final move first.
    Score increases as RM and BM approach zero with the human’s turn next, as it allows the computer to win.

2.Misere Version:

    The goal is to force the human to take the last marble, causing them to lose.
    In this mode, the score increases for states that limit moves and drive the opponent closer to taking the last marble.
    Moves that leave one marble of either color score highest, as this sets up an unavoidable loss for the opponent.

3.Heuristic Scoring:

    +10 points for each remaining red or blue marble if it leaves the opponent in an unfavorable position.
    +50 points for configurations that approach the game’s end in the computer’s favor.
    -10 points if the current player is forced to take the last marble in "misere" mode.

    
Output
Returns a numeric score that indicates the desirability of the current game state, guiding the computer to seek positions that increase its winning chances based on game rules.
