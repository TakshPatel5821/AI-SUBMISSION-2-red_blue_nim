The Minimax algorithm uses an evaluation function to award a certain game state a numerical score. The evaluation function's goal is to calculate how advantageous a specific situation is for the computer player. The state is more beneficial to the computer when the score is higher.
We constructed a straightforward evaluation function based on the quantity of marbles in the red and blue piles for the game "Red-Blue Nim." We want to reward states that are closer to attaining this goal since the aim is to make the opponent take the last stone.

This evaluation function's justification is as follows, the state_evaluation function is used to return a score based on the misere rule if the game is over (one of the piles is empty). We wish to prevent such states because in misere mode, the person who grabs the final marble loses. It's a good result because this is the state we want in standard mode.

This evaluation function can help the computer player make better decisions and perform better in the game when used with depth-limited Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
